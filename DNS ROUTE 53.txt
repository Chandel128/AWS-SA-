#######Route 53#####
.com top level domain
example.com - second level domain
www.example.com -full domain name
api.www.example.com-sub domain

Route 53 highly available scalable and authorative dns
autorative user can manag their records
how you want to route traffic to your domain
host the domain names

A-Map your domain name to ipv4
aaaa-domain name to ipv6
cname-hostname to a hostname
nameserver--dns server -they are dns name ip address of these server respond to dns query
how user requests 

Public hosted zones -contain records that specify how to route traffic  on the internet
Private Hosted Zones:Contain records that sepcify how your route traffic within one or more vpc for private company

ttl -time to live how much time route53 taking to return request
TTL stands for "Time to Live." It is a setting associated with each DNS record and determines how long a DNS resolver or client should cache the DNS information 
before querying the authoritative nameservers again for fresh data.

ALIAS POINT A DAOMAIN NAME TO A AWS RESOURCE
WORK FOR ROOT DOMAIN AND NON ROOT DOMAIN
ITS FOR:
LB
CLOUD FRONT
BEANSTALK
VPC END POINT 
  DOES NOT APPLICABLE TO THE EC2 DNS
  
  
  ROUTING POLICIES OF DNS
  in dns routing does not mean routing traffic it means responds to dns queries
  simple
  weighted
  failover
  Latency based
  Geolocation
  Multi-Value Answer
  Geoproximity
  
  
  Health checks
used to check the health of your resources before routing the user request 
  can only be done for public hosted zone not for private zone which are hosted in vpc 
  solution you have to set a cloudwatch metric and create the alarm then itself it will create the health check
  
  
 Failover Routing Policy
 Ec2 -Primary
 Ec2-secondary/Disaster Recovery
 so now route 53 will route the requests as per date before checking it with health checks if  primary fails then it will go to secondary
 
 Geolocation
 Based on geolocation
 can be associated with health checks
 restrict content sharing,load balacning
 any user located to asia go to this ip
 so you can set policies as per that
 
 
 geoproximity
 Route traffic to your resources based on the location of users and resources
 ability to shift more traffic to resources based on defined bias
 you have to set defined value
 expand
 shrink
 
 Resource1              Resource 2
 us-east1               us-west1
 bias 0                   bias0
 traffic will be divided equally
 
 if we set bias=50 in resource2 then the traffic will be more in the Resource2
 
 
 IP based Routing
 Routing based on ip addresses of clients
 you provide a list of your client CIDR(Classless inter domain routing) and the corresponding endpoints
 optimize performance and reduce network costs
 
 
 Multi-Value
 When you want to route the traffic to multiple resources
 can be associated with health checks
 up to 8 healthy records run for each multi value query
