*EC2 ON-demand
*Reserved Instances-66 DISCOUNT
reserve for1 year and 3year
steady state application like database
Convertible can change the ec2 instance tenancy os
*EC2 SAVING PLANS-72 
*ec2 spot instance-can loose at any time if current price is more than your price
used for workloads that are resilent for failures
data analysis
image processing
Batch jobs
distributed workloads
*Ec2 dedicated hosts-a physical server totally distributed to you
*EC2 dedicated instances-insatnce running on hardware dedicated to you
*EC2 Capacity Reservations



#Spot instances-2 min grace period
spot requests one time-persistent (if your ec2 some how terminated your request goes back in loop.
delete the request first then instances


Spot fleet-mix of on demand + spot instance-spot fleet will try to meet the target with target constraints-IT give us extra saving option in choosing spot instances
have multiple launch pools so fleet can chooose
 strategies to allocate spot instances
 lowest price-pool from lowest price
 diversified-diversifies across multiple pools
 capacity optimized-pool with optimal capacity
 price capacity optimized:pools with highest capacity and then select the lowest price from that
 
 
 
 ####Placements groups
 sometime you want to control over your ec2 placement strategy
 CLUSTER instance in a low latency group in a single availability zone-same rack same az so if rack fail all insatnces fail at same time
 when we use it -we want big data job to complete fast-high n/w for application
 spread-spread instances across underlying hardware-all instances are not diff hardware-less risk failures-limit 7 instaneces per AZ
 USE CASE CRITICAL APPLICATION
 HIGH AVAILABILITY
 CRITICAL APPLICATION IN WHICH INSTANCES SHOULD BE ISOLATED FROM EACH OTHER
 
 partition-spread instances across multiple PARTITIONS
 7 PARTITION PER AZ PARTITION IS Basically a rack 
 rack 1 -us-east1
 rack2-us east2
 big data hadoop,kafka
 
 #Elastic n/w interface-it is like moving your network card from one ec2 to another like transter public ip from one ec2 to another
 EC2 Hibernate:
 you want to save the ram state and without restarting os it will only restart the memory
 hibernate-ram state into a file in ebs volume -ram will start again
 not more than 60 days
 ebs must be encrypted
 
 
 
 ########################EC2 STORAGE#################################
 
 ####EBS VOLUME-NETWORK DRIVE to store data
 attached to one instance at a time except multiattach
 these are bound to zones
 but we can use snapshots 
 ssd
 gp2/gp3
 io2/io2-critical workloads
 critical business workloadd
 database
 st(hdd) can not be a boot volume for big data data warehousing 
 sc(hdd)
 
 ebs multiattach-io2/io3 family
 you can attach volumes and attach it to multiple instance up to 16 instances at a time
 
 ###Snapshots
 you can archive your snapshots also you will need 24 to 72 hours in need to restore it 
 
 #EC2 instance store-high performance hardware disk ,use ec2 instance store
 it is ephermal storage once you terminate the instance you will lost it 
 for long time storage ebs is better
 better I/O performance
 
 
 #EFS-Network File system that can be mounted on many ec2
 this file system can be connected to multiple instances at a same time
 can be used for webserver,data sharing,wordpress 
 applicabe to only linux
 EFS -PERFORMANCE AND STORAGE CLASS
