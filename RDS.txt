##########RDS SERVICE- to manage database on cloud and it will be managed by AWS#####
OPTIONS:
MYSQL
MARIADB
POSTGRESSQL
AURORA-AWS PROPIETARY SERVICE
ORACLE
IBM DB2


WHY RDS
rds is managed service Automated provisioning,os patching
Continuos backups and restore to a specific timestamp
Monitor dashboards
Read Replicas for improved performance
Multi AZ setup (Disaster Recovery)
Maintanence windows for recovery
stroage backed by ebs
scalaibility
you cant be login into rds instances ssh

Storage Autoscaling
increase the storage on your db instance dynamically
when rds detects you are running out of free db storage it scales automatically
you have to set a maximum limit 
support multiple database engine
Automatically increase storage if 
  free storage is 10% of allocated storage
  Low storage last atleast 5 minutes
  6 hours have been passed since last modification
  
Useful for application with unpredeictable workloads
since you cant access your rds instance you have create a another ec2 in same subnet and then connect the database



Diff between Read replicas and multu az exam perspective
Read replication-Replication of data in same region or cross region
Up to 15 Read replication 
Asynchronous replication-there will be some lag to replic data from primary db insatnces
n asynchronous replication, changes from the primary system are replicated to the secondary systems with some delay. 
Instead of waiting for confirmation that changes are applied on the secondary systems before committing transactions on the primary system, 
the primary system continues processing transactions without waiting for acknowledgment from the secondary systems.
Replication agents or processes periodically read the transaction log from the primary system and replicate the recorded changes (data modifications) to the secondary systems.
 These changes are applied to the secondary systems asynchronously, meaning there's a delay between the changes occurring on the primary system and
 their replication to the secondary systems.
 
 Application must update the connection string to leverage read replicas
 
 NOTE:Read replicas are only used to read not insert update and delete
 
 Use case
 
 
      Production application                          reportingA	Application
	  
	  
	   write/read                                     Read
	   
	   primary db instance                              replica
	   
	   now i want to run report analysis on this db it will overload and affect the application what we can do now now make a reporting application and add read replica it will take read from that
	  
	  
in aws there is n/w cost if data transfer from one az to another
but in rds you dont pay that us east1 useast2 no cost
but cross region will cost you 




RDS Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)

Application

ONE DNS NAME-AUTOMATIC FAILOVER
so application will talk to the dns name and increase the availability
rds db instance AZ(A)     -sync replication-    RDS DB instance standby  AZ(B)-its for standby not for scaling


NOTE:YOU CAN SET UP YOUR READ REPLICA AS MULTI AZ FOR DISASTER RECOVERY

RDS FROM SINGLE AZ TO MULTI AZ
no downtime operation
you need to just click 'modify' for the database
how it happend behind the scenes
it will take a snapshot of master and restore it in another ec2


You can use sqlelectron in order to connect to your database


RDS CUSTOM -you know that you can access the db instance with rds 
but rds custom is available for oracle and sql  
you can acess os and do all the activities using ssh and ec2
deactivate automation mode so eds does not perfrom any automation




######AMAZON AURORA#######-exam questions 
propeitary technology of aws not open source
support -postgress and mysql 
it is cloud optimized and it provide better performance
Aurora storage automatically grows in increments of 10GB and upto 128TB
Aurora can have upto 15 replicas and replication process is much more than faster than mysql

Aurora High Availibility and Read Scaling
6 copies of your data across 3 AZ
SHARED STORAGE VOLUME
REPLICATION SELF HEALING AUTO EXPANDING
ONE INSTANCE TAKES WRITES(master)
Automated failover for master in less than 30 seconds
read replications autoscalng up to 15

#########
Aurora also provide  Aurora db cluster contain 
writer endpoint point to master-so that in any case the master stops client will be redirected to the another db instance
Reader endpoint-it will point to the replicas so if client connect to this they will connect to the replicas

AURORA FEATURES

                     write          read
                      Shared storage volume
  we can use custom endpoints also in reader replicas we can add diff configuration like d2 medium lasrge
  YOU WILL NOT USE READER ENDPOINT AFTER CUSTOM ENDPOINT
  
  
  
  Aurora Serverless
  aurora will manager everything 
  
  client will talk to proxy fleet
  then it will talk to aurora replicas
  
  
  
  Aurora Global
  Aurora cross region replicas
  aurora global database(recommended)
  primary db 
  secondary db upto 5 in multiple regions,replication lag is very 1 secondary
  16 per region
  less than 1 min for cross region data replication
  
  
  
  Aurora Machine Learning
  Sagemaker use with any ml model
  comprehend for sentiment analysis
  
  
  
  RDS BACKUP
  AUTOMATED BACKUPS
  TRANSACTION LOGS ARE BACKED BY RDS EVERY 5 MINUTES
  1 TO 35 DAYS OF RETENTION SET 0 FOR AUTOMATED BACKUPS
  
  
  manually db snapshots
   trick -stopping a rds databse will still cost you more so  you can create a snapshot and restore it
   
   
   Aurora backups
   Automated
   1 to 35 days can not be disabled
   manual in time recovery-you can recover from any point of time
   
   
   Manuall backups
   db snapshots
   retention period as long you want
   
   RDS AND AURORA RESTORE OPTIONS:
   
   
   1. SNAPSHOTS
   2.RESTORING FROM S3-FOR RDS DATABASE
     STORE YOUR ON PREMISE DB IN S3
	 RESTORE IT USING BACKUP FILE AND RUNNING IN INSTANCE
3. FOR AURORA CLUSTER DB 
   STORE YOUR CLUSTER BACKUP USING PERCON XTRA BACKUP
   STORE THIS BACKUP FILE IN S3 
THEN RUN IT ON NEW AURORA CLUSTER


AURORA DB CLONING -BASICALLY A STAGING CLUSTER
FASTER THAN SNAPSHOTS



RDS AND AURORA SECURITY
ENCRYPT USING KMS

AUDT LOGS CAN BE STORED AND SENT TO CLOUDWATCH FOR RETENTION
