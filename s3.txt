#infinity scaling storage
s3 store data on buckets
and buckets are like directories and files are storing in buckets
Buckers are defined at the region level

Objects these objects have a key:
The key is the full path:
https://s3/mybucket/myfile.text
The key is comprised of prefix + object name

The s3 objects are knows as key
size 5tb max
above 5gb use multi parts upload


s3 security:
user based:
IAM Policies which api calls should be allowed for a specific user for iam
resource based:
Bucket Policies:bucket wide rules from the s3 console-allows cross account
 Object Access Control list-finer grain can be disabled
 Bucket ACL-less common can be disabled


Note: the iam principal can access an s3 object if iam permissions allow it or resource policy allows it
and there is no explicit for deny


Encryption - encrypt the s3 object with api keys

S3 bucket policies:
Resources:buckets and objects
Effect-Allow/deny
Actions -Set of api to allow/deny
Principal-the account or the user policy apply to


#S3 Versioning
you can version your files in s3
enabled at the bucket level
It is best practice to version your budgets
Protected against unintended deletes
Easy roll back to previous version

Suspending versioning do not delete previous versions
File uploaded before versioning is going to be null written against them



Amazon s3 Replication
After you enable replication you can add new objects
to replicate existing objects also you have to do batch replication

Delete marker are not replicated but you can also enable them 


Storage classes in S3
Standard-general purpose
Frequently accessed Low latency
Big Data analytics,Mobile and gaming applications
Standard-Infrequent Access-Disaster recovery,backups
One zone -in single AZ and data lost if AZ Crashed

Amazon Glacier -low cost storage for archive/backups
Amazon Glacier Instant retrieval-Miniseond retrieval - great for data accessed once a quarter-Minimum storage duration for 90 days
Amazon Glacier Flexibal retrieval-Expedited 1 to 5min  Standard(3 to 5 hr)  Bulk (5 to 12 hours)
Glacier Deep Archive-Standard (12 hours)  Bulk(48 hours-long storage lowest cost 180days
Intelligent Tiering-move objects automatically between access tiers


You can use lifecycles policies to move the objects in diff stroages classes
