######Cloudfront#########
Content Delivery Network
caching data on edge location


Cloudfront Origins
S3 bucket
For Distributing files and caching them at the edge 
Enhanced security with cloudfront origin Access control
OAC is replacing Origin Access Identity
Cloudfront can be used as an ingress(to upload files on s3)


Custom Origin(HTTP)
Application Load Balancer
EC2 instance
S3 Website(must first enable the bucket as a static s3)


Cloudfront vs S3 cross region Replication
Global Edge Network
Files are cached at TTL(maybe a day)
Great for static content that must be available everywhere


S3 Cross Region Replication
Must be setup for each region you want replication to happen
Files are updated in real time
Read Only
Great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low latency in few regions



#Loadbalacner as a Origin
Cloufront>>Edge Locations>>Pulblic ip of edge locations>>Ec2 Instances must be public
Cloudfront>>ALB>EC2 PRIVATE>aLLOW SG TO EC2 FROM ALB 


####cLOUDFRront Geo Restriction


## Cloudfront-Pricing-edge locations are all around the world
The cost of data out per edge location varies


Price Classes:
Price Class All-best performance all region
Price Class 200-most regions,but excludes the most expensive regions
Price class 100-only the least expensive regions


Cloudfront-Cache Invalidation
If you update the backend origin(s3,lb) and CF does not know about this and will get the refreshed content after ttl has expired.
However you can force an entire cache refresh  by prrforming a cloudfront invalidation to bypass ttl.



####Global Accelerator ##
Global users for our application
you have deployed an application and you have global users who want to access the application
They can go the internet which can add a lot of latency due to many hops
We wish to go as fast as possible through AWS network to minimize latency


Unicast vs Anycast Ip
one server hold one ip address-unicast
all server hold same ip address and client is routed to nearest one 

Global Accelerator works on the Anycast 
Leverage the Aws internal network to route to your application
2 Anycast Ip are created for your application
The Anycast Ip send traffic directly to Edge Locations
The Edge Locations send the traffic to your appplication
Works with Elastic Ip,EC2 instances,ALB,NLB,public or private 
It also perform health check for your applications


Difference b/n GA and Cloudfront
Both use global Network and edge locations around the world 
Both integrates with Aws Shield for DDOS protection


Cloudfront
Improve performance for both cacheable content(such as images and videos)
Dynamic Content (such as Api acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
Content is served at the edge

GA
Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or Udp
Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more Aws Regions
Good fit for non http use cases such as gaming(UDP), IOT,Voice over Ip


yOU HAVE TO ADD YOUR ENDPOINT GROUP IN GA 
ENDPOINT CAN BE EC2 ,ALB,NLB,ELASTIC IP

It will route you to the application nearest to your location
