####ELB AND ASB#########
Scalibility and High Availibility:
Vertical Scalibility to increase the size of instance from t2 medium to large
Horizontal Scalibility-to increase the number of instance

High Availibility means to run your app in two AZ to avoid datacentre loss 


Load balancer:
why we use it
Spread load across multiple instances
expose a single point of access for your application
provide ssl termination
JUST EXPose your ec2 to just your elb sg 


type
classical lb
1.application lb - layer 7 http,https,websocket 
it for multiple applications on same machine microservices
Route based on a path url www.example.com/url www.example.com/hosts
ALB are great fit for microservices and container based application ECS AND DOCKER


2. n/w lb-transport layer 4 -tcp udp tls
High performance millions of requests per second
NLB has one static ip per AZ 
Health check of nlp supports tcp,http,https protocol

3.gateway lb-layer 3 -network layer-ip protocol

deploy scale and manage a fleet of 3rd party network virtual appliances in AWS
EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT YOUR NETWORK TO PASS THROUGH THE firewall,Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems,Deep packet Inspection system,Payload Manipulation
you want the traffic coming to your application first inspected
user traffic will first goes through the gateway load balancer
USE THE GENEVE PROTOCOL ON 608

Stickiness:the client request will go to the previous ec2 oonly
you have to defined custom cookies

Cross zone load balancing
we are distributing the traffic evenly across all the registred instances in all availability zones


SSL/TSL BASICS
SSL CERTIFICATE allows the traffic between and the load balancer to be encrypted in transit
Ssl secure sockets layer
tsl transport layer security newer version

SNI server name indications
solve the problem of loading multiple ssl certificates onto one server 
newer protocol and reuire the client to enter the hostname of target server for initial handshake
server will find the correct certificate and return the default one
but only applicable for alb,nlb and cloudfront


When using an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to your EC2 instances, the IP address you'll receive requests from will be the ALB's private IP addresses. To get the client's IP address, ALB adds an additional header called "X-Forwarded-For" contains the client's IP address.
Question 5:
You are using an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to your website hosted on EC2 instances. It turns out that your website only sees traffic coming from private IPv4 addresses which are in fact your Application Load Balancer's IP addresses. What should you do to get the IP address of clients connected to your website?


#####ASG#######
Scale out - to match the increased load- add ec2 instances
Scale in - to match a decreased load-remove ec2 instances
Ensure we have minimum and max number of instances running
Automatically add ec2 instances to load balancer
Recreate an Ec2 instance if previous one is unhealthy
ASG is Free you only pay for the resources you use
it is possible to scale your ASG using the cloudwatch Alarms


ASG SCALING POLICIES
DYNAMIC POLICY-Target Tracking Scaling-i want the cpu usage to be around 40%

Simple/Step SCALING
When a cloudwatch alarm trigger cpu>70% then add 2 units
when a cloudwatch alarm trigger cpu >30% then remove 2 units

Schedule Scaling -Automatic scaling based on usage patterns
increase the ec2 on 10 to 5pm on friday

Scaling cooldowns;after a scaling activity you will be on cooling perios approx 300 seconds
During the cooldown Aws will not launch any ec2 instance
Advice-use ami ready to use to reduce cooling period
