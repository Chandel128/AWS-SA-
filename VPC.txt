######################VPC######################
Cidr-classless internet domain routing
0.0.0.0/32


Baseip-represents a ip in the range of xx.xx.xx.xx
   

Subnet Mask
Defines how many bits can change in the ip
can take two forms:  /8 255.0.0.0
                     /16 255.255.0.0
					 /24  255.255.255.0
					 /32  255.255.255.255
					 
					 
The subnet mask basically allows part of the underlying ip to gets additional next values from the base ip
/32 2^0   192.168.0.0
/31 2^1   192.168.0.0  192.168.0.1
/30 2^2
/29 2^3


Octets
/32-no octet can change
/24-last octet can clange
/16-last 2 can change
/8-last 3 octet can change
/0-all octet can change



Internet Gateways and Route Tables

Internet Gateways are used to provide internet access to your resources(EC2) in your Vpc
but we have to edit route table so that it can connect to ec2 and then connect to router and from router to internet gateway
we have to add a route for over internet gateway 

0.0.0.0/0	igw-0dca9dff2879f2178	Active	No    this means any ip on internet will have access to this .
172.31.0.0/16	local	Active	No     Means any ip within this will have access to vpc


so any ip with 172.31.00.0/16 route to local vpc
any ip with 0.0.0.0 route the traffic to internet gateway



Bastian Hosts
To access the ec2 in private subnet
you have add a rule from private ec2 to sg of bastian with ssh 22



###############
NAT Instance and NAT Gateway:
Network Address Transition
Allow ec2 in private subnet to get access to internet
NAT instance is outdated now but it must be created in public subnet
Launch this instance in the public subnet and then add a elastic ip to this
Route tables must be configured to route traffic from private instance to ec2


Create a nat instance you will find the ami in marketplcae
Edit route table 
from any ip 0.0.0.0 goes thorugh NAT instance ec2id 
In Nat instance you have manage them yourself less bandwidth less availability

So we use ##########AWS Managed NAT Gateway#######
it is aws managed and use elastic ip
it should be in other ec2 not on same subnet as ec2
It require a internet gateway Private>>NAT.>IGW
In summary, while a NAT Gateway enables outbound internet access for instances in private subnets,
 an Internet Gateway is still necessary for overall connectivity to the internet and for enabling bidirectional communication with resources outside of your VPC.
 Both serve different purposes and are often used together to achieve a comprehensive networking setup in AWS.
 NAT Gateway will also need internet connectivity
 NAT gateway is resilient in single Availability zone
 mUST Create a multiple NAT gateways in multiple AZ for fault tolerance

setup 
create a NAT GATEWAY ALLOCATE IP THEN 
ADD RULE
0.0.0.0 nat gateway


###########NACL and Security group##################
NACL -Network Access control list-extra layer of protection
NACL is stateless means you have to set inbound as well outbound rules both are evaluated 
SG is statefull means if it accepted the inbound then outbound will be allowed also.Only one is evaluated
Rules>>NACL>>SG RULES>>EC2


NACL are like firewalls which allow traffic from and to subnets
One NACL per subnet,new subnets are assigned the default NACL
You have to define NACL rules:
Rules will have a number (1-32766) higher precendance with a lower number 
First rule will match the decision
Example:if you define #100 ALLOW AND #200 DENY it will take 100 rule first
NACl will block an Ip at an subnet level 

Default NACL Accept everything inbound/outbound with the subnets it is associated with
Do not modify the default Nacl creae a custom NACL


####EPHERMAL PORTS##########
for any endpoints to establish a connection,they must use ports
Client connect to a defined port, and expect a response from a ephermal ports


NACL WITH EPHERMAL PORTS##########

WEB SUBNET PULIC                           DATABASE SUBNET PRIVATE 
NACL                                          NACL
ALLOW OUTBOUND TCP TO 3306                  ALLOW INBOUND TCP TO 3306
ALLOW INBOUND TCP TO 1024-65535             ALLOW OUTBOUND TCP ON PORT TO 1024-65535
FROM DB SUBNET CIDR                         TO WEB SUBNET CIDR

Stateful-return traffic is automatically allowed,regardless of rules.
Stateless-return traffic must be explicitly allowed by rules



NACL will apply to all the ec2 within in the subnet

###########VPC Peering#########
Privately connect two Vpc using AWS Network
vpc peering connection is not transitive must be established for each vpc that need to communicate with each other.
You can create VPC peering connection between vpc in different AWS regions/accounts

Create a Vpc peering connections using peering connections service

remember vpc cidr shuld not concide
You have to set route now any connection with vpc cidr and select peering connection on both vpc with same entries.


############AWS PRIVATE LINK=VPC ENDPOINT
Suppose we have a ec2 in private network and we want to access to differenct aws services like cloudfront,s3,rds 
so we have to create a vpc endpoint and then connect it directly 
otherwise it will follow ec2.>nat..>>igw>internet>sns service  this is also a method but we have to go through IGW and NAT gateway then it will be done amd it will create more cost.
vpc endpoint will be deployed in your vpc and it will connect your private ec2 with your vpc

Interface Endpoints-Provision as ENI (private ip address)as an entry point must attach to a security group
Gateway Endpoints-Provisions a gateway and must be used as a target in route table (does not use security groups) support both s3 and dynamo db

Exam : Gateway or interface endpoint for S3 ?
Gateway is most likely to be perferred all the time at the exam 
Cost for free for gateway $ for interface you just have to add a target in route table

Interface endpoint is needed only when access is required from On-premises a different VPC or a different region Site to Site Vpn or Direct Connect,a different vpc or different region.



######VPC flow logs###################
Action;success and failure of request due to security group/NACL
can be used for analytics on usage pattern or malicious behaviour
Query Vpc flow logs using Athena on s3


Vpc Flow Logs Infrastructure:
VPC Flow logs:Cloudwatch Logs:Cloudwatch  Contributor Insights :Top 10 IP addresses
VPC Flow Logs:Cloudwatch logs:CW Alarm:Amazon SNS
VPC Flow logs:S3 Bucket:Amazon Athena:Amazon Quicksight


how to set Amazon Athena for vpc flow logs
create tables and queries



#####AWS site to site Vpn###########
Virtual Private Gateway
 Vpn concentrator on Aws side of the VPN connection
 VGW is created and attached to the VPC from which you want to create the Site-to-site Connection
 
 Customer Gateway
 Software application physical device on the customer  side of the VPN connection
 
 Customer Gateway Device(On premise_)
  What ip address to use?
  Public Internet routable ip address for your customer device
  if its  a NAT device thats enabled for the NAT traversal use the public ip address of the NAT device.
  Important Step:enable Route Propagation in your vpc  for the Virtual Private Gateway in the route table that is associated with your subnets .
  if you need to ping your ec2 instances from on premises make sure you add the ICMP protocol on the inbound of the Security Group.
  
  For multiple site customer networks and you need multiple vpn connections 
  use aws vpn cloudhub
  
  
  
  ###########Direct Connect######
  Provide a dedicated private connection from a remote n/w or vpc
  DX must be setup between your dc and aws direct connect locations
  you need to setup virtual private gateway on your vpc 
  Access public resources(s3) and private ec2 on same connection
  
  Use cases:
  Increase bandwidth throughput-working with large data sets -lower cost 
  More consistent n/w experience -application using real time data feeds 
  Architecture:
  
  VPC EC2        Virtual Private Gateway   AWS Direct connect Location (AWS Direct Connect Endpoint) -(Customer or partner router)  Corporate data Centre(Customer router/firewall)
                                               Private Virtual Interface
											   Public Virtual Interface 
  
  It does not go through the public internet.
 
 
 
 #########Direct Connect-Resilency
 *High Resilency for critical workloads
 you have to create multiple Aws Direct connection to  multiple corporate centre
 *Max resilency for critical workloads
 Multiple connection of Aws Direct connect 
 Max resilence is acheived by separate connections terminating on separate devices in more than one connection.
 
 
 In case you create direct connection and you want to create backup so you can create site to site vpn connection.
 
 
 
 Transit Gateway:For having transitive peerings between thousands of VPC and on premises,hub and star connection.
 
 Transit Gateway :Site to Site VPN ECMP (Equal cost Multi -path routing)
 Use Case:Create multi Site-to -Site VPN Connections to increase your bandwidth of your connection to AWS
 IF YOU  want to connect multi vpc from your site then you have to create Transit Gateway 
 Transit Gateway -Share Direct Connect between multiple accounts
 
Vpc
vpc   Transit Gateway  Direct Connnect Gateway  AWS Direct Connection VLAN Customer site



Egress only Internet gateway similar as NAT gateway but for ipv6 


Network Protection On AWS
NACLS
VPC SG
AWS WAF(protect against mulicious requests)
AWS shield & shield advanced(For Ddos Protection)
AWS firewall manager (to manage them across accounts)



But what if we want to protect in sophisticated way our entire vpc
AWS Network Firewall- it uses aws gateway load balancer


VPC Traffic Mirroring
Allows you to capture and inspect Network traffic in your Vpc
Route the traffic to security appliances you manager 
It will capture the traffic to security appliances you manage



success alert
Good job!



AWS VPN CloudHub allows you to securely communicate with multiple sites using AWS VPN. It operates on a simple hub-and-spoke model that you can use with or without a VPC.
Question 15:
Your company has several on-premises sites across the USA.
 These sites are currently linked using private connections, but your private connections provider has been recently quite unstable, making your IT architecture partially offline. 
 You would like to create a backup connection that will use the public Internet to link your on-premises sites, that you can failover in case of issues with your provider. 
 What do you recommend?
