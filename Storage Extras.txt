#######################AWS Storage extras#########
AWS SNOW FAMILY
Highly secure,portable, devices to collect data at the edge and migrate data in and out of the Aws.

Data Migration:
Snowcone
Snowball Edge
Snowmobile


Edge Computing:
Snowcone
Snowball Edge

Snowball-like a box provided by aws you will put your data in this then aws will transfer
How it works
client - directly upload to s3

client>snowball  ship  aws snowball  import/export s3 - Data migration from physical route not from n/w route 
Physical data transport solution
Alternative to moving data over the network


Snowcone&Snowcone SSD
Device used for edge computing,storage and data transfer
Use snowcone where snowball does not fit(space constrained environment)
Must provide your own battery and cables
can be sent back to aws offline or connect it to internet and use Datasync to send data back to aws


AWS Snowmobile-its actually like a truck for transferring of data


2nd Use Case;
Edge Computing
Process data while its created on edge location:
what is edge location:these location may have limited or no internet acccess 
Limiting or no easy access to computing power
We setup a Snowball Edge /Snowcone device to do edge computing



AWS Opshub:to use snow Family devices,you needed a CLI



Solution Architecture:Snowball into glacier
Snowball can not import to glacier directly
You must use S3 first in combination with s3 lifecycle policy





###Amazon FSX#########
launch third party high performance filesystem on AWS
Fully Managed Service


Amazon FSX for windows(File Server):
fully managed windows file system drive
can be mounted on linux ec2 instances


Amazon FSx for Lustre
Lustre is a parallel distributed file system for large-scale computing 
Video Processing,Financial Modelling,Electronic Design Automation



FSx File system Deployment Options:

Scratch File System
Temprary storage
Data is not replicated (does not persist if file server fails)

Persistent file system
long term storage
Data is replicated within same AZ
Replace failed files within minutes


Amazon Fsx for Netapp ONTAP
Managed Netapp ONTAP on AWS
File system compatible with NFS,SMB,iSCSI protocol
Move workloads running on ONTAP or NAS to AWS 


Works with:
Linux
windows
macos
Vmware cloud on AWS 


Amazon fsx for openZFS
Managed OpenZFS filesystem on AWS
File System compatible with NFS(v3,v4,v4,)
Move workloads running on ZFS to Aws

Storage Gateway-it is bridge betweeen your onpremises data and cloud data

##########Hybrid Cloud for storage##
Part of your infrastructure on the cloud
Part of your infra on premises


This can be sue to 
Long Cloud migrations
security requirements
Compliance Requirements
IT Strategy

S3 is a propietary storage Technology so how do you expose the S3 data on premises
AWS storage gateway

it is bridge betweeen your onpremises data and cloud data
Use cases:
Disaster Recovery
Backup and restore
tiered storage
on-premises cache and low latency file access


Types of storage gateway

*Amazon s3 file gateway

Configured S3 buckets are accesible using NFS/SMB Protocol
Most recently used data is cached in the file gateway
Bucket access iam roles for each file gateway
smb protocol has intergration with AD for user authentication


Corporate Data centre                                                            aws Cloud 
Application server   >> NFS OR SMB >> S3 FILE GATEWAY        https            s3 objects          lifecycle policy for archive




#FSx file gateway
Accesss from on premises to amazon cloud 
if from on premises smb cliets want to access windows file server

Corporate Data centre                                                            aws Cloud 
Application server   >> smb client gateway  >> fsx file  GATEWAY                Windows file server  >Amazon fsx>> file systems


#Volume gateway
Block storage using iSCSI(Internet Small Computer System Interface) protocol backed by S3
Backed by EBS snapshots which can help restore on premises volumes
Cached volumes:low latency access to most recent data
stored volumes:entire dataset is on premise,scheduled backup to s3


Corporate Data centre                                                            aws Cloud 
Application server   >> iscsi  >> volume GATEWAY     HTTPS            S3 Bucket >> Amazon EBS Snapshots 



##Tape GATEWAY
Some companies have backup processes using physical tapes
With Tape Gateway companies use the same processes,but in the cloud 
Virtual Tape Library backed by Amazon s3 and glacier


GATEWAY SHOULD BE ON CORPORATE DATA CENTRE BUT if you do not have the resources you can also uses a Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance:

Amazon Transfer Family:
A fully managed service for file transfers into and out of Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS using FTP protocol
AWS Transfer to sftp
for ftp 
for ftp (only within vpc)


####################################################
Amazon Data Sync
Move large amount of data to and from 
on premises/other cloud to aws (nfs,smb,HDFS,S3 API..) --needs agent 
AWS to Aws no agent needed


Can synchronize to :
Amazon S3(any storage classes -including Glacier)
Amazon EFS
Amazon FSX (Windows,lustre,Netapp,Open zfs )

Replication tasks can be scheduled hourly,daily,weekly

File permissions and metadata are preserved


How it works:
Corporate Data centre                                                            aws Cloud 
NFS  server   >> NFS OR SMB PROTOCOL >>  aws DATASYNC AGENT    tls          AWS Datasync >> AWS storage resources(S3,EFS,FSX)

we can use snowcone(because it has datasync agent preinstalled also)
